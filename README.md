# Fétiche

Fétiche is a magic item which will lead your software to successful development. Once you installed it into your project directory, the project will get supercharged with the supernatural power which will definitely reduce any form of loathed flaws in the entire development processes, such as build failures, design mistakes, bugs, and even typos.

Although the package is distributed upon the NPM infrastructure, Fétiche's metaphysical abstraction allows you to choose what kind of language and environment to use in your enchanted project. Of course the effect can be applied to your entire machine by installing globally–in such case your machine should not emit flawed commits anymore–but it is strongly recommended to install per project because of consistency amongst developers. Fétiche is primarily a talisman for individual softwares.

# How to use

Just install this package into your project.

```
npm install fetiche
```
